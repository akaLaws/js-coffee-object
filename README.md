# js-coffee-object
An example on how you can use objects in JavaScript to brew a decent mug of coffee. This particular example was used in class to show of objects, properties and methods.

## How to get it
The comments are somewhat self explanatory. 
It's a simple and fun example on how you can play arround with objects and hopefully get a deeper familiarity with javaScript syntax. 

What is reguired to know -ish to get it?
* Variables
* Primitive datatypes
* Operators
* Functions with arguments
* Conditional statements - if, else if, else

So take a peak, have a laugh and make your own object. Have some fun! ðŸ¤˜
